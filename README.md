Welcome to my portfolio, it is available at this [link](https://dayknightmare.github.io/portfolio/), it contains some project statements, my knowledge in programming, database and tools, as well as a brief description about me.

It was made with JavaScript, HTML and simple Scss, but thinking about clearly demonstrating what needs to be passed regarding the demonstration of my works, thank you for seeing.
